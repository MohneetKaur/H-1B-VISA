# H-1B-VISA
H1-B Visa is the most sought-after non-immigrant visa that allows foreign workers to work in United States in specialty occupation.There were more than 180,000 
new applicants for H1-B [2], however, only 80,000 applications were picked up in the lottery process for taking it further to USCIS for approval.
We plan to use the anonymized dataset for 2019 that United Status Department of Labor publishes publicly and apply data science techniques to improve predictability 
of approval.
We start with null hypothesis that there is a correlation between the profile of an employer and the outcome of a visa application. 
We plan to model that in this paper and predict whether an application will get rejected or approved. However, we limit the dataset to H1-B visas which is most popular work visa for an immigrant, but it can be extended to other visa types as well.
